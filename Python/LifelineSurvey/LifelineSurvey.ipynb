       "      <td> At last, an opportunity to share my own thoughts!     Our agency is tiny, starting from a purely volunteer organization. The cut in the stipend was painful for such a small organization.    The advertising and promotion of the Lifeline via your office are important to us, since we don't have funds for advertising.    Last year, I asked for some special reports and the staff did all they could to accommodate our needs. Yay!    In the last five years, we've been a big increase in calls with serious suicide and mental health issues. We found that we could no longer leave volunteers alone to handle these calls and reduced our hours to make it possible to have a paid counselor on duty at all times during the times of highest volume. The Lifeline made this possible, so that our region is still receiving 24 hours help even if we can't afford.     ASIST: We're struggling to keep up with the reporting demands by LivingWorks (the two ASIST trainers are both on provisionary status), and wish we could afford to get a new staff member trained. So my big wish would be a suicide intervention training that is comparable to ASIST without the very fussy requirements for reporting, the expensive materials, the lack of flexibility in how the materials is presented (only for two solid days, only with two trainers), the need for 24 participants (when our typical training classes are 6 to 8).     The intervention simulation program somehow slipped under our radar. I see information about it in the newsletters but haven't had time to explore it.     Other things that would be better for us:  -- opportunities to link with the call centers that pick up our calls when we close - maybe small regional gatherings once a year? We rarely get to the AAS conferences.  -- data regarding the number of calls we are missing when we closed  -- an end-of-year report for all Lifeline calls sent to our center  -- monthly rather than weekly reports   -- a quicker access to the PSAP page and other in-call resources for counselors on duty, without password, or with a separate password from our account management</td>\n",

For the ones not checked, \"not particularly valuable\" would be the correct response.  ASIST training would be useful if more accessible.  A bit                                                                                                     It sounds nice to say we're part of a national network.  It is consistent with our mission.  Some of the training & best practice info, along with the marketing materials, are good.  The expectations of being a member of the network are not commensurate with the funding, so increasing the funding would be an improvement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

We have experienced a great deal of staff turnover and programmatic challenges in the past 6 months, which have reduced our hotline from 24 hours/day to less than 12 hours/day. We cannot overstate how much we appreciate the patience of NSPL and your willingness to work with us. We are doing our best to restore our crisis center to full operating capacity, and appreciate the extra support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Our agency is tiny, starting from a purely volunteer organization. The cut in the stipend was painful for such a small organization.    The advertising and promotion of the Lifeline via your office are important to us, since we don't have funds for advertising.    Last year, I asked for some special reports and the staff did all they could to accommodate our needs. Yay!    In the last five years, we've been a big increase in calls with serious suicide and mental health issues. We found that we could no longer leave volunteers alone to handle these calls and reduced our hours to make it possible to have a paid counselor on duty at all times during the times of highest volume. The Lifeline made this possible, so that our region is still receiving 24 hours help even if we can't afford.     ASIST: We're struggling to keep up with the reporting demands by LivingWorks (the two ASIST trainers are both on provisionary status), and wish we could afford to get a new staff member trained. So my big wish would be a suicide intervention training that is comparable to ASIST without the very fussy requirements for reporting, the expensive materials, the lack of flexibility in how the materials is presented (only for two solid days, only with two trainers), the need for 24 participants (when our typical training classes are 6 to 8).     The intervention simulation program somehow slipped under our radar. I see information about it in the newsletters but haven't had time to explore it.     Other things that would be better for us:  -- opportunities to link with the call centers that pick up our calls when we close - maybe small regional gatherings once a year? We rarely get to the AAS conferences.  -- data regarding the number of calls we are missing when we closed  -- an end-of-year report for all Lifeline calls sent to our center  -- monthly rather than weekly reports   -- a quicker access to the PSAP page and other in-call resources for counselors on duty, without password, or with a separate password from our account management\n",
