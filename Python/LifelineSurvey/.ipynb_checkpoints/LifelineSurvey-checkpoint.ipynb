For the ones not checked, \"not particularly valuable\" would be the correct response.  ASIST training would be useful if more accessible.  A bit                                                                                                     It sounds nice to say we're part of a national network.  It is consistent with our mission.  Some of the training & best practice info, along with the marketing materials, are good.  The expectations of being a member of the network are not commensurate with the funding, so increasing the funding would be an improvement.\n",

For the ones not checked, \"not particularly valuable\" would be the correct response.  ASIST training would be useful if more accessible.  A bit                                                                                                     It sounds nice to say we're part of a national network.  It is consistent with our mission.  Some of the training & best practice info, along with the marketing materials, are good.  The expectations of being a member of the network are not commensurate with the funding, so increasing the funding would be an improvement.\n",
