#Overview

## Background
Welcome!  This is a short onboarding course for new data analysts.  I'll cover the basics of data preparation, data analysis, and machine learning.  No other knowledge is necessary other than a very minimum familiarity with Excel.

* __Data Preparation__
    - Extraction
    - Transformation
    - Loading
* __Data Analysis__
    - Descriptive Statistics
    - Inferential Statistics
* __Machine Learning__
    - Numpy
    - Scipy
    - Scikit-Learn
* __Data Visualization__
    - Tableau
    - D3.js
 
## Data Analysis
There can be two types of data:

* __Qualitative__ - deals with observations (unmeasurables like colors, smells)
* __Quantitative__ - deals with numbers (measurables like length, age)

__Variables__
Data is made up of variables.  Variables can be any type of value (like an observation or number).  `y = 10` says that the variable '_y_' has the value of '_10_'.  There are two types of variables:

* __Independent Variable__ - the outcome; the variable's value does not depend on any other variable (e.g. _Has Lung Cancer_, _Test Score_)
* __Dependent Variable__ - the predictor(s); the variable(s) that we think are an effect because the value depends on the independent variables (e.g. _Cigarettes Per Day_, _Time Spent Studying_)
* __Example__: _Time Spent Studying_ causes a change in _Test Score_.  _Test Score_ can't cause a change in _Time Spent Studying_.  _Test Score_ (independent variable) depends on _Time Spent Studying_ (dependent variable)
